This folder contains my work in Digital Signal Processing (DSP).

DSP is the use of complex trigonometric mathematics to decomposition and manipulation of signals/waveforms for communication, audio engineering, or machine learning.

This folder contains entry level DSP concepts such as FIR filter design, frequency filtering, and spectral density analysis.
