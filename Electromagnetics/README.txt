This folder contains my work in electromagnetics (EM).

EM is the study of the behaviour of electrical and magnetic fields. EM can be mostly described by Maxwell's equations. 

Files in this folder contain entry EM concepts such as 1D simulation, finite-difference time-domain method, and the effect of permitivity on wave propagation.
