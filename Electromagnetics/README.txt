Electromagnetics is the study of the behavioural of electrical and magnetic fields. Electromagnectics can be mostly described by Maxwell's equations. 

Files in this folder contain entry electromagnetics concepts such as 1D simulation, finite-difference time-domain method, and the effect of permitivity on wave propagation.
